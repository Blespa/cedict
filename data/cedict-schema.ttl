<> dct:description """

    This ontology pertains to representations of Chinese Lexical
    information, particularly to RDF translations of CEDICT, available
    from
    <https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/export/cedict/cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt.gz>,
    Discussed at <https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict>
      
    Licenced under <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>.

    Per the conditions of said license, this RDF representation is
    licensed under the same terms.

    Chinese has a couple of peculiarities. Its written form extends
    over a number of dialects with radically different
    pronunciations. There is no morphology to speak of, so each
    lexical entry is its own canonical form.

    CEDICT's English representations are descriptions, some subset of
    these descriptions may be aligned to English lexica, but this file
    renders these descriptions as 'glosses'.
     
    The following new constructs are defined:
    * zh:Cedict, naming the lexicon
    * zh:ChineseTextualForm, subsumed by both ontlex:LexicalEntry and 
      ontolex:Form
    * zh:CedictEntry, a zh:ChineseTextualForm entry in zh:Cedict.
    * natlex:inLexicon owl:inverseOf lime:entry, to facilitate definintion of 
      zh:CedictEntry
    * zh:pinyin, a sub-property of ontolex:phoneticRep 
    * en:gloss, an English description of each lexical sense.
    * zh:Cedict
    
    These Ontolex constructs are used directly:
    * ontolex:writtenRep
    * ontolex:sense
    * ontolex:LexicalSense, each instance of which is given an en:gloss
      assertion (see description below) Each lexical sense is named
      with a numeric #-fragment appended to its corresponding
      ChineseTextualForm.

    CEDICT provides written forms in both simplified and traditional
    forms.  The simplified form, being the offical form for the
    People's Republic of China, are tagged as @zh. When the
    traditional form for an entry differs from the simplied form, a
    second writtenRep assertion is made, tagged as @zh-Hant.
